Otoliths preserve a chronological record of a ishâ€™s metabolic activity and the physical and chemical characteristics of the water in which the ish resided during the time of deposition. Isotope turnover rates tend to be strongly correlated with growth rate and accretion of biomass in teleost ishes. Seascape coniguration played a critical but heretofore- unrecognized role in determining connectivity among habitats. Phenomenon: The distribution of bomb radiocarbon in the ocean. Otolith chemistry analyses indicate that water Sr:ca is the primary factor in determining the structure of ish otoliths.

The Southern Ocean is home to one of the largest concentrations of plankton in the world's oceans. Plankton trophodynamics at the subtropical convergence, Southern Ocean, is the subject of this article. The use of otolith chemistry to characterize migrations to characterize otoliths has been used in the study of migrations of the otolith. The study of the use of diadromous migrations has also been used to characterize the migrations.
